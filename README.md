Open-Sourced Custom MineCraft-Classic Server Software

##LegendCraft-About
 [LegendCraft](http://www.risingembers.us) is an open-sourced software for minecraft classic servers. 
LegendCraft is forked from [800Craft](http://www.800Craft.net), which was developed by Jonty800, GlennMR, and Lao Tszy. 
The 800Craft project was a software that was forked from Fragmer’s [fCraft](http://www.fCraft.net). 
LegendCraft is designed to withstand a large server load,
while maintaining an impressive performance with a large array of features and customization.

##LegendCraft-The History
 LegendCraft was founded in summer of 2012 (july 24th),
where it started out as a nameless ‘800Craft custom edition’ software. 
Eventually, LeChosenOne, the sole developer at the time gave it it’s name,
‘LegendCraft’. After the first release, it was quickly found out by a few servers,
most notably by ‘Rising Embers.’ DingusBungus, the host of Rising Embers
wanted to help out with the LegendCraft project, and has since joined the development team.
LegendCraft spread to a few more servers until Eeyle learned about the software.
Probably out of boredom, Eeyle eventually joined the team. 

##LegendCraft-Installation
 For Windows, LegendCraft requires Microsoft .Net Framework 4.0. Many computers come already installed with it.
If you do not have this installed, please visit http://tinyurl.com/7vrsjj3.

For Linux, Mac OSX, and Unix distributions, please download mono 2.10. 
Download can be found at http://www.mono-project.org/. To be able to run GUIs, please make sure that you have GDI+ library (libgdiplus). Also, make sure to give read/write access to the LegendCraft directory. To run ".exe" files with Mono, use the following syntax: Mono 2.6.4: "mono SomeFile.exe" Mono 2.8+: "mono --gc=sgen SomeFile.exe" If you're intending to run a public server that appears on minecraft.net's server list, you need to import https certificates to tell mono you trust them, this can be done by running mozroots --import --ask-remove as the LegendCraft user on your system.
